# [EcoDraw](https://www.ecodraw.io)

This project is a web application designed to help users design and manage energy systems by populating a canvas with various devices (like transformers and energy storage units). The app includes a map integration for geographic context, a backend powered by Node.js and Express.js, and a frontend built with React.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=18.x)
- Docker (for deployment)
- Supabase account

### Clone the Repository
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/g-blok/ecodraw.git
cd ecodraw
```


## Install Dependencies
Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories and install dependencies:
``` sh
# For frontend
cd frontend
npm i

# For backend
cd ../backend
npm i
```

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in both frontend and backend directories and include the following:
### Frontend (frontend/.env)
``` sh
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
```

### Backend (backend/.env)
``` sh
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8000  # frontend app port
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

## Running the Application
### Development
#### Backend
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```
#### Frontend

``` sh
cd frontend
npm run start
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:8000 and the backend at http://localhost:5000/api.

## Deployment
### Docker
To containerize and deploy your app, follow these steps:

- Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
- Update your domain's DNS settings in your domain manager (I use Porkbun) to point to your host server's IP address (I use Hostinger VPS).

### Build and run the containers:

``` sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

Access your app via the domain youâ€™ve configured in your domain manger.

## UX/UI

### Vision and Branding

The vision for this tool is to create a light, welcoming, and professional environment that evokes a new perspective on being green. The branding centers around muted earth tones like moss and riverstone, with a color palette and font choices that offer a solarpunk vibe. The aesthetic is designed to be secure enough to manage business operations while remaining approachable and engaging enough for users to spend hours in. This balance of professionalism and playfulness is intended to make the tool both functional and enjoyable to use.
